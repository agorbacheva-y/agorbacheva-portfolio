        <p>
          I am a California transplant currently living in Sweden with experience working in 
          three countries (US, Japan, Estonia) in account management at a certification agency 
          and in payment operations at a fintech prior to switching careers to web development.
          I studied front-end development at Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola and am keen to start
          a career in this field to work alongside amazing programmers and learn much more!

          Outside of coding, I also love to dance and work with children! I taught children's ballet
          and also volunteered as an English tutor, Japanese teacher, and reading coach.
